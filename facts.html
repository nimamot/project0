  <h2> 1_ Canada's lowest recorded temperature is as cold as Mars</h2>
  <p>One of the least surprising facts about Canada is that it can get pretty cold in the winter (anyone who's ever had to chisel their car out of a block of ice in the morning knows this to be true). The average low for the month of January in Ottawa is -14.4 C (6.1 F). That's pretty cold! However, a temperature recorded in 1947 in Snag, Yukon makes the rest of Canada's winter weather seem like a relaxing beach vacation. A temperature of -63 C (-81.4 F) was recorded in the small village of Snag on Feb. 3, 1947. That's roughly the same temperature as the surface of Mars.</p>

  <h2>2_ Canada is bigger than the European Union</h2>
  <P>Ever been travelling abroad and had someone ask you if you know Kimberly from Vancouver or Theo from Montreal after you told them you were Canadian? Our country's vast land area often hard to comprehend for those who haven't experienced it firsthand. Here are some facts about Canada to put its breathtaking scale into perspective: It's bigger than the entire European Union (33 times bigger than Italy and 15 times bigger than France), more than 30 per cent larger than Australia, five times as big as Mexico, three times as big as India and about the same size as 81,975 Walt Disney Worlds put together. So, in other words, no, you don't know Kimberly or Theo!</p>

  <h2>3_ Alert, Nunavut, is the world's northernmost settlement</h2>
  <p>At the northern tip of Ellesmere Island, just 817 kilometres from the North Pole, you'll find the northernmost permanently inhabited place in the world: Alert, Nunavut. It might not have malls or movie theatres but Alert is the temporary home to military and scientific personnel working in the area. The "temporary home" part will make sense once you realize how cold this place gets: the warmest month, July, has a balmy average temperature of 3.4 C (38.1 F). By January, the coldest month, the mean temperature has plunged to -32.19 C (-26 F). No wonder they named it Alert.</p>

  <h2>4_Canada has the world's longest coastline</h2>
  <p>f you walked and never stopped—not to eat, not to rest your feet, not to get some sleep—it would take you four-and-a-half years to walk the length of Canada's coastline. While our country might not conjure up images of blue waters and white sandy beaches, Canada has the world's longest coastline, bordered on three sides by three different oceans: the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific. To put that fascinating fact about Canada in perspective, that accounts for 202,080 of the world's total 356,000 kilometres of oceanfront property.</p>

  <h2>5_ Canada has 10 per cent of the world's forests</h2>
  <p>One of the most widely-known facts about Canada is that we've got an abundance of trees, but did you know that Canada actually boasts 30 per cent of the world's boreal forest and 10 per cent of the world's total forest cover? An incredible 396.9-million hectares of forest and other wooded land can be found across the country, and 68 per cent of that is coniferous.</p>

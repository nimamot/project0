# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
my project0 is made of 6 different .html web pages,  one .css stylesheet for the index.html, and a .scss( which has been converted to .css) for the 4 other websites. The index.html contains the most information about my topic and each of the 4 other web pages are about some additional information.  The index.html contains a table, 6 pictures, an ordered list, a group of cards( using bootstrap 4 component), and 4 containers (using bootstrap's grid model) which linkes the index. html to the 4 other pages. The .css stylesheet  includes a variety of CSS properties and CSS selectors.  I've used @media query for styling the Image.html page in a way that the number of pictures in a row will changes based on the width of the screen.  The variables.scss contains examples of nesting, inheritance and variables in SCSS.

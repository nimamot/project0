  <p>Winter in Canada means knee-high boots, snow pants, and so many layers you can barely see your face. It means wearing gloves under your mittens and trying to stay cozy however you can. It also means being damn proud of just how miserable your city really is and how tough its people are.</p>

  <p>Winter in Canada is generally December, January, and February, though winter weather can start in November and last through late March, early April, especially in the eastern part of the country.
The height of winter is freezing cold in most places except for the BC coast, where winters are moderate with little snow. Nearby Whistler, on the other hand, gets loads of snow and is a major ski destination through May.
In the Rockies, winter is long. However, snow stays around only in the higher altitudes. Calgary does not get much snow, but Banff and Canmore may get two feet in April. In addition, southern Alberta gets winter relief from warm Chinook winds.
Eastern Canada, including Toronto and Montreal, has a short, fierce winter, below zero temperatures most of the time, and -20C (-4F) not uncommon. At least one or two snowfalls of eight inches or more will likely hit in January and February.</p>
